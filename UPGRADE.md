# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading from 0.4 to 0.5

The `mail-allowlist.php` configuration structure has changed. You should compare and incorporate any of these changes into your existing file if you have previously published it. (It may be easiest to make a backup copy of your existing file, re-publish it from this package, and then re-make your customizations to it.)
